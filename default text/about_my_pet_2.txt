So back 18 years ago I had these two dogs that were sisters. Chihuahuas. Every time we left things would get destroyed. Paper chewed up all over just a cereal mess. We thought it was the bigger one. So we would crate her before leaving and always come home to a clean house. One day I decided to set up a camcorders and record when I left to see what was happening. Turns out the little one was the trouble maker but smart enough to not do things when her sister was crated. As soon as the car doors closed she was grabbing a roll of toilet paper. I was both amused and mad about it.
