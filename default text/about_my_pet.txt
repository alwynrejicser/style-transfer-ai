Last year I adpoted a kitten and I can't even put in words how much she's been helping me. Taking her home with me was in fact an impulsive decision, but it was the best thing I ever did. If it wasn't for her my last major episode would've ended drastically bad, I only came out of bed to take care of her and play a bit, and everytime she sees me crying almost immediately she lays down on my chest so I can pet her. If I could give y'all any advice aside of taking your treatment seriously is have a pet. They'll give you the sense of responsibility and distract you when you're down, plus you'll have a pure love that doesn't go away
